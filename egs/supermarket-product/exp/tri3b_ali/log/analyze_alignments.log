The optional-silence phone sil occupies 45.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 37.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.9 hours of data, or 0.5 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 10.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (51,52.6,81)
