The optional-silence phone sil occupies 45.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 40.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (46,46.3,76)
