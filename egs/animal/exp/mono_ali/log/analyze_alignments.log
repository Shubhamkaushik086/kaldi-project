The optional-silence phone sil occupies 46.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 41.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.5 hours of data, or 0.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (49,49.9,82)
