At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (124,124.0,124) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (85,85.0,85) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 78.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,12.8,17) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 21.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,59.2,85) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 17.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,13.5,15) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 13.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,18.0,16) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 13.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,11.3,12) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, o_E accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
Overall, p_B accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, rr_B accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, rr_I accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, sh_I accounts for 4.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 56.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 60.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 27.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 14.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,29.0,29)
