analyze_phone_lengths.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,84.0,84) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 70.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,13.9,16) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 23.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,82.2,84) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 17.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,16.0,16) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 17.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,15.3,16) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 17.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, p_B accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, rr_B accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 62.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 59.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 20.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,81.7,31)
