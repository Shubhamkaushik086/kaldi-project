The optional-silence phone sil occupies 72.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 97.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 71.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 15.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (123,155.4,277)
