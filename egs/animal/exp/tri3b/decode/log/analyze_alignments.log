analyze_phone_lengths.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, spn_S accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,84.0,84) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,12.1,16) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,133.0,84) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,17.0,16) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,13.5,12) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,9.5,6) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.0,31) frames.
Overall, p_B accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, rr_B accounts for 8.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 75.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 76.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 20.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (35,157.5,35)
