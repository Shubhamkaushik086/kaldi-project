At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,84.0,84) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,14.1,19) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 27.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,68.6,84) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,17.0,16) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,15.3,16) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,13.7,13) frames.
Overall, spn_S accounts for 5.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 5.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
Overall, p_B accounts for 5.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, rr_B accounts for 5.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,15.0,15) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 65.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 56.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 18.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,81.0,32)
