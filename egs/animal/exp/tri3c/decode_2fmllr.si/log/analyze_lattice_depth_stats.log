The total amount of data analyzed assuming 100 frames per second is 0.0 hours
Overall, lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(3,4,5) and mean=4.2
Phone sil accounts for 94.9% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(3,4,5) and mean=4.2
Nonsilence phones as a group account for 5.1% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(3,4,4) and mean=3.7
Phone a_I accounts for 2.3% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(3,4,4) and mean=3.7
Phone l_I accounts for 0.8% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(4,4,4) and mean=4.0
Phone v_I accounts for 0.5% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(4,4,4) and mean=4.0
